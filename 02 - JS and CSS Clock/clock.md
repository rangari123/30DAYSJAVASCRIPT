# clock

The provided code is a JavaScript code snippet that animates clock hands to display the current time on a web page. Let's go through the code line by line and explain each part:

// get all hands

# const secondHand = document.querySelector(".second-hand");

# const minuteHand = document.querySelector(".min-hand");

# const hourHand = document.querySelector(".hour-hand");

These lines use document.querySelector() to select elements with class names "second-hand", "min-hand", and "hour-hand" from the HTML page. These elements are the hands of the clock that we will animate to show the current time.

# function setDate() {

# const now = new Date();

# const second = now.getSeconds();

# const min = now.getMinutes();

# const hour = now.getHours();

# }

The setDate() function is responsible for getting the current time and calculating the angles at which each clock hand should be rotated to represent the time. It uses the Date object to get the current date and time. Then, it extracts the seconds, minutes, and hours components from the date using getSeconds(), getMinutes(), and getHours() methods, respectively.

# const seconddegreeConvert = (second / 60) \_360 + 90;

# const minutegreeConvert = (min / 60) \_ 360 + 90;

# const hourgreeConvert = (hour / 12) \* 360 + 90;

These lines calculate the degrees of rotation for each clock hand. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, the seconds are converted to degrees by dividing by 60 and then multiplying by 360. Likewise, the minutes and hours are converted to degrees using the same logic. The + 90 is added to compensate for the initial offset, so the hands start pointing to the 12 o'clock position.

# secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${seconddegreeConvert}deg)`;

# minuteHand.style.transform = `rotate(${minutegreeConvert}deg)`;

# hourHand.style.transform = `rotate(${hourgreeConvert}deg)`;

These lines set the CSS transform property of each clock hand's element to rotate them by the calculated degrees. This way, they appear to move smoothly and show the current time.

# setInterval(setDate, 1000);

This line calls the setDate() function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) using the setInterval() function. This ensures that the clock hands are updated every second, creating the illusion of a continuously running clock.

# important

The reason we do not divide by 24 when calculating the rotation angle for the hour hand is because the hour hand on a standard analog clock completes one full rotation (360 degrees) in 12 hours, not 24 hours.
